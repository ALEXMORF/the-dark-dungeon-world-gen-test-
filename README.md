# the-dark-dungeon-world-gen-test-
a test program to test the robustness of my game "the dark dungeon"'s world generation code

if you run the program, just press "R" to regenerate the world to see it generates a new one. 

#procedural generation method

First generate random rectangles that are apart at least 1 tile, then carve passengers by flood-filling randomly. (So far)
